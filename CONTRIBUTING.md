# Contributing

This is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute,
feel free to do this, but remember to follow this few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- __Always__ as base for your changes use `master` branch (all new development
  happens here),
- Commit your code, but do not mess with the `Version`, or
  `CHANGES.md`,
- __Remember__: when you create Pull Request, always select `master` branch as
  target, otherwise it will be closed (this is selected by default).
